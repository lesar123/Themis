Themis is tool for ethical hacking... 

U can preform scripted nmapscans, deauther attacks, google dorks... (its still project in work, comment if u have sugestions)

For google dorks u just need to create custom google search engine use https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/

And to see API key use  https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction

Plus just put your worldlist in password_file in main.py for bruteforce e.g /home/user/Downloads/10-million-password-list-top-100000.txt

UPDATES:

I added some new features on google dorks, fixed that when u didnt get any output from search (or some) --> now it asks u if u want to search every component separately
